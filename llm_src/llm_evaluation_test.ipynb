    "\n",
    "## What & Why\n",
    "This notebook evaluates whether LLMs can:\n",
    "1. **Impute missing/generalized values** - Predict original values that were anonymized (e.g., `[30-39]` → `35`, `young` → specific age)\n",
    "2. **Predict target variables** - Classify outcomes (label inference) from privacy-protected features\n",
    "\n",
    "## How it works\n",
    "1. **Load two datasets**: Anonymized data (with `?` and generalized values) + Original data (ground truth)\n",
    "2. **Define task-specific prompts**: Separate configurations for imputation and prediction with embedded system prompts\n",
    "3. **Call LLM API**: Parametric function using LLM API URL and Model from .env_llm (in project root)\n",
    "4. **Compare predictions vs ground truth**: Calculate accuracy, analyze by value type and column"
